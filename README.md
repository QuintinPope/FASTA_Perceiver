# FASTA_Perceiver
Work in progress.
This code prepares HMMER annotated FASTA data and implements a perceiver language model with a masked language modeling objective.

See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v18jY-Ji3XzGcZXDEKYcLIiv5PpP2nlDWdsaLsoGQcw/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions on finding appropriate protein sequence and metagenomic data and on using HMMER to annotate that data.
